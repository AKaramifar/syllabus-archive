### The Network Tab

The most important part of the Network Tab to explain is the relationship between the HTML file and the requests that are subsequently made.

That is to say that when a HTML is parsed that GET requests are made to the resources that are required to view the page. This can be shown by

- Showing how a JavaScript file is referenced in a `<script>` tag and is then loaded in the Network Tab
- Showing how an `<img>` tag referenced a `src` attribute and the image is loaded in the Network Tab

### Exercise - GET Requests

The aim of this exercises to let the students explore the network tab and spending some time reading code.

When the class has submitted their lists open the network tab and see exactly what was requested by the website. Have a discussion around each of the GET requests. You can find the website in the exercise [here](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/Network-Tab-Example/).

For students that go very quickly through the exercise send them to a complicated website and continue to let them explore through the exercises

### Exercise - POST Requests

Again, the aim of this exercises is to let the students see how requests can be triggered by a button click and forces them to see the difference between a GET and POST request.

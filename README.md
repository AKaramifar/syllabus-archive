This is the syllabus and course material for
[Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/) (CYF),
a not-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build
anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application!

The eight-month course contains:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Back-end development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* Front-end development using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

We'll complement the course with workshops on modern software methodologies
and job interview practices.

# Final Project - Week 2

## Demo (45 minutes)

Integrate all of your work together and share your progress so far with the mentors.

Your presentation should last **no more than five minutes** and could include:

- Slides detailing what you've done this week
- UI/UX designs of your project
- A live example of your project

## Retrospective (30 minutes)

Retro's can help a team focus on what is important and what they can improve for the next week.

- 5 mins - Individually everybody notes down.
  - You should include:
    - All the things that went well
    - All the things that didn't go well
    - Anything you should
- 10 minutes - In your groups discuss the ideas raised and group them together
  - Don't talk about solutions yet!
  - Identify key problems
- 15 mins - talk about solutions and identify actions to tackle problems

- **User research**: show what you’ve built and what you’re planning to build next to potential users (other students, mentors, etc.) and use any feedback they have to improve your plans.
- **Sprint planning**: decide what you’re each going to be doing during the following week and where you want to be by the next class.
- **Technical support**: mentors will be on hand to help you get unstuck from any blocking technical issues.

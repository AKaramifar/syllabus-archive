## Teams

Before class starts volunteer and student teams should have been assigned.

You can find an example of the team structure from London Class 6 - [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118OW-fpJfv2ZMOtQfTYkTmQUg2rTQXq5xBCzy9JdWMk/edit#gid=0)

All students should make sure that they are comfortable with their roles and what they will be required to do. More information about roles can be found [here](./roles)

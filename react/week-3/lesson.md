## Recap

Last week we looked at using props and state to create React components that change with user input ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-3-state-recap-38x3b?file=/src/Counter.js)):

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

We also looked at fetching data in our React components ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-3-recap-h2p24?file=/src/MartianPhotoFetcher.js)):

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const MartianPhotoFetcher = () => {
  const [marsPhotos, setMarsPhotos] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`
    )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setMarsPhotos(data));
  }, []);

  if (!marsPhotos) {
    return null;
  } else {
    return (
      <img
        src={marsPhotos.photos[0].img_src}
        alt="Mars Rover"
        style={{ width: "100%" }}
      />
    );
  }
};

export default MartianPhotoFetcher;
```

## Updating Data Fetching when Props Change

Last week we looked at how we could fetch data from an API and render it in our React applications. However, there was a problem with the method that we learned before. To understand this problem we first have to understand the *lifecycle* of a component.

### The Circle of Life

Let's take a look at an example:

| **Exercise A** |
| :--- |
| 1. Open [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-prop-updates-not-working-x1dox?file=/src/App.js). |
| 2. Take 5 minutes to read the code. |
| 3. Click the "Fetch image for 2019" button. **If you're feeling confident**: predict what is going to happen before you click the button. |
| 4. Now click the "Fetch image for 2020" button. What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? Can you explain why? |

Together let's "play computer" to break down exactly what is happening with these components:

1. When the page loads, the `App` function component is called
2. It doesn't have any `date` state already, so we initialise it to an empty string (`""`) with `useState`
3. It renders the 2 buttons, but because `date` is an empty string, it does **not** render the `MartianImageFetcher` component. Instead `null` is returned, which means that nothing is rendered
  ```js
    function App() {
      const [date, setDate] = useState("");

      ...

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={handle2019Click}>Fetch image for 2019</button>
          <button onClick={handle2020Click}>Fetch image for 2020</button>

          {date ? <MartianImageFetcher date={date} /> : null}
        </div>
      );
    }
  ```
4. When we click the "Fetch image for 2019" button, the `handle2019Click` click handler is called
5. The state is set by `setDate` to be `"2019-01-01"`, and a re-render is triggered
6. The `App` function component is called again
7. This time, `useState` remembers that we have `date` state and it is set to `"2019-01-01"`
  ```js
    function App() {
      ...

      function handle2019Click() {
        setDate("2019-01-01");
      }

      ...

      return (
        ...
        <button onClick={handle2019Click}>Fetch image for 2019</button>
        ...
      );
    }
  ```
8. Now `App` **does** render `MartianImageFetcher` and passes the `date` state as a prop (also named `date`)
9. The `MartianImageFetcher` function component is called for the first time
10. `useState` knows that we haven't got any `imgSrc` state so initialises it to `null`
11. We queue an effect, which will run after we render for the first time
12. Because the `imgSrc` state is set to `null`, we return `null`. This means that nothing is rendered
  ```js
    function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
      const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        ...
      }, []);

      if (!imgSrc) {
        return null;
      } else {
        return <img src={imgSrc} />;
      }
    }
  ```
13. Now that the component has rendered for the first time, the effect is run
14. A `fetch` request is made to the NASA API (ðŸš€!)
15. When the request data comes back, we set the `imgSrc` state to a piece of the data, which triggers a re-render
  ```js
    function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
      ...

      useEffect(() => {
        fetch(
          `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${
            props.date
          }&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`
        )
          .then(res => res.json())
          .then(data => {
            setImgSrc(data.photos[0].img_src);
          });
      }, []);

      ...
    }
  ```
16. The `MartianImageFetcher` function component is called again
17. `useState` remembers that the `imgSrc` state is set to the data from the API
18. This time, we do **not** queue an effect. We used an empty array (`[]`) as the `useEffect` dependencies argument which means that we only queue effects on the **first** render
19. We do have `imgSrc` state set, so we render the image using the data from the API ðŸŽ‰
  ```js
    function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
      const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

      ...

      if (!imgSrc) {
        return null;
      } else {
        return <img src={imgSrc} />;
      }
    }
  ```

Phew! That was a lot of work just to render an image! But we're not quite done yet, we still need to find out what happens when we click the "Fetch image for 2020" button:

1. In the `App` component, the `handle2020Click` click handler is called
2. The `date` state is set to `"2020-01-01"` and a re-render is triggered
3. The `App` function component is called again and the `date` state is set to `"2020-01-01"`
4. The `date` prop that is passed to `MartianImageFetcher` is **different** which means that it has to re-render
  ```js
    function App() {
      ...

      function handle2020Click() {
        setDate("2020-01-01");
      }

      ...

      return (
        ...
        <div>
          ...
          <button onClick={handle2020Click}>Fetch image for 2020</button>
          ...
          {date ? <MartianImageFetcher={date} /> : null}
          ...
        </div>
        ...
      );
    }
  ```
5. In the `MartianImageFetcher` component `useState` remembers that we already had `imgSrc` state. It is set to the image from 2019
6. Again, we do **not** queue the effect because this is a re-render and `useEffect` has been passed an empty array `[]`
7. Because `imgSrc` state has been set previously we render the image from 2019
  ```js
    function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
      const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        ...
      }, []);

      return <img src={imgSrc} />;
    }
  ```

| **Exercise B** |
| :--- |
| 1. Did you spot where the bug was? Discuss with a group of 2 - 3 students where you think the bug is. |
| 2. Report back to the rest of the class where you think the bug happened. |

The key that the `useEffect` in `MartianImageFetcher` is **only run once**. This is because we told React that the queue should be queued on the first render only. However, as we saw, sometimes you need the effect to run again when some data changes. In this case the `date` prop, changed from `"2019-01-01"` to `"2020-01-01"`, meaning that we have to fetch data different data. We call this a *dependency* of the effect.

### `useEffect` dependencies array

To solve this problem, we can tell React to queue the effect on the first render **and** when a dependency changes. We do this by adding the dependency variable to the array ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-prop-updates-working-64vw3?file=/src/App.js)):

```js
function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
  const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    ...
  }, [props.date]);

  ...
}
```

Now when the `date` prop changes, React knows that the effect must be run again, this time with the 2020 data. Because of this behaviour, the second argument to `useEffect` is called the *dependencies argument*. We use it whenever we have something in our effect that *depends* on a variable outside of the effect function.

To help you understand this better, try "playing computer" again, but this time think about what happens when we use `[props.date]` for the dependencies argument. Think carefully about what changes with step 6 after we click the 2020 button.

| **Exercise** |
| :--- |
| 1. Open the `pokedex` React application from last week and open the `src/BestPokemon.js` file. |
| 2. Copy the `BestPokemonSelector` component from [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/bestpokemonselector-component-mdz0o?file=/src/BestPokemonSelector.js). Then paste it into `src/BestPokemon.js`. |
| 3. Change the `default export` so that it exports `BestPokemonSelector` instead of `BestPokemonFetcher`. |
| 4. Take a few minutes to read what the `BestPokemonSelector` component does. If you have questions, ask a Teaching Assistant to help. |
| 5. In the `BestPokemonFetcher` component change the URL to use backticks (`` `...` ``) instead of double-quotes (`"`). Then replace the number 1 with `${props.pokemonId}`. What will this do? <details><summary>Click here if you don't know</summary>The URL will contain the pokemonId instead of always fetching the pokemon with id of 1</details> |
| 6. Open your browser and find the `BestPokemonSelector` component. **Before you click the buttons**, think about what you expect will happen. Then click the "Fetch Bulbasaur" button to find out what actually happens. |
| 7. Refresh the page. What happens now if you click the "Fetch Bulbasaur" button, then click the "Fetch Charmander" button? Is this what you expected? Explain to someone why this happens. |
| 8. Fix the bug by adding `props.pokemonId` to the `useEffect` dependencies array in `BestPokemonFetcher`. Remember that you can test if the bug still happens by refreshing the page, clicking one of the buttons, then the other button. |

### ESLint rules for React Hooks

As you may have noticed, VSCode highlighted the empty dependencies array when you changed the URL passed to `fetch` in `BestPokemonFetcher`.

This is because your React application is using the rules from [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), a package created by the developers who make React. It helps you to find bugs in React Hooks code by highlighting places where you might be missing dependencies.

If you see a red squiggly line underneath your `useEffect` dependencies array, you can hover your mouse over and it will tell you which variable is missing so you can add it to the dependencies array. Here's an example:

![React Hooks eslint rule](../assets/eslint-hooks-rule.png)

### Loading state

| **Exercise A** |
| :--- |
| 1. Open [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-prop-updates-working-64vw3?file=/src/App.js). |
| 2. Click the "Fetch image for 2019" button and wait for the image to load. |
| 3. Now click the "Fetch image for 2020" button. Do you think this is a good experience for the user? Explain what you think is wrong to a Teaching Assistant. |

In the application above, the image from 2020 takes a while to load. This makes it feel like the app is broken: the user might think that they didn't actually click the 2020 button or that it is not working correctly. We are not telling the user that *something* is happening, it's just taking a bit of time to load.

We can fix this by adding a *loading state*. Let's take a look ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-loading-state-part-1-7bi9z?file=/src/FetchWithLoadingState.js)):

```js
function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
  ...

  if (!imgSrc) {
    return "Loading...";
  } else {
    return <img src={imgSrc} />;
  }
}
```

Previously, we were just rendering nothing (by returning `null`) when we didn't have any `imgSrc`. We can tell the user that this by instead rendering something telling them that we're still waiting for the data to come back.

There is still a problem though: when we click to fetch another image, we still have `imgSrc` set to the previous image. What we could do instead is set the `imgSrc` back to `null` when we know that we're fetching another image ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-loading-state-part-2-dvu6k?file=/src/FetchWithLoadingState.js)):

```js
function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
  ...

  useEffect(() => {
    setImgSrc(null);

    ...
  }, [props.date]);

  ...
}
```

| **Exercise B** |
| :--- |
| 1. Open the `pokedex` React application again and open the `src/BestPokemon.js` file. |
| 2. In the `BestPokemonFetcher` component, instead of returning `null` if there is no `pokemon`, return `"Loading..."`. |
| 3. Now add `setPokemon(null)` inside the `useEffect` callback, before the call to `fetch`. |
| 4. Try clicking on the "Fetch Bulbasaur" and "Fetch Charmander" buttons quickly. Do you see the loading state? (It may only appear for a flash, the Pokemon API is very fast). |

## Working with forms in React

Modern web applications often involve interacting with forms such as creating an account, adding a blog post or posting a comment. This would involve using inputs, buttons and various form elements and being able to get the values entered by users to do something with it (like display them on a page or send them in a POST request). So, how do we do this in React?

A popular pattern for building forms and collect user data is the *controlled component* pattern. A *pattern* is a repeated solution to a problem that is useful in multiple similar cases. Let's have a look at an example ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/controlled-component-4jq1yqy8kx?file=/src/SimpleReminder.js)):

```js
function SimpleReminder() {
  const [reminder, setReminder] = useState("");

  function handleChange(event) {
    setReminder(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Some reminder"
        value={reminder}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <p>Today I need to remember to... {reminder}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We're controlling the `value` of the input by using the value from the `reminder` state. This means that we can only change the value by updating the state.

It is done using the `onChange` attribute and the `handleChange` function which is called every time the input value changes (typically when a new character is added or removed).

If we didn't call `setReminder` in the `handleChange` function, then the input's value would never change and it would appear as if you couldn't type in the input! Finally, the value we keep in the `reminder` state is displayed on the screen as today's reminder.

In addition, instead of just saving the value of the input in the state, we could have also transformed the string before we set it with `setReminder`, for example by calling `toUpperCase()` on the string.

### Form with Multiple Fields

Let's have a look at a more complex example where we want to build a form to let users enter information to create a personal account ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/controlled-component-createaccountform-m7p083zn6p?file=/src/CreateAccountForm.js)):

```js
function CreateAccountForm() {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState({
    username: "",
    email: "",
    password: ""
  });

  function handleChange(event) {
    const updatedUserData = {
      ...userData,
      [event.target.name]: event.target.value
    };

    setUserData(updatedUserData);
  }

  function submit() {
    console.log("Do something with the form values...");
    console.log(`Username = ${userData.username}`);
    console.log(`Email = ${userData.email}`);
    console.log(`Password = ${userData.password}`);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          placeholder="Username"
          value={userData.username}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="email"
          placeholder="Email"
          value={userData.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="password"
          name="password"
          placeholder="Password"
          value={userData.password}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <button type="submit" onClick={submit}>
        Create account
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We now have three different inputs named `username`, `email` and `password`, and we keep each entered value in state as a field in an object. The method `handleChange` is reused to keep track of changes for **all** the values. The trick here is to use the `name` of the `<input>` element to update the corresponding state.


#### Updating an Object in State

Did you spot the strange syntax in `handleChange`?

Let's start with the second new bit of syntax first. The `[event.target.name]` bit is called a *computed property name*. Inside a JavaScript object, you can use a variable wrapped in square brackets which acts as a dynamic key, such as:

```js
const myFirstKey = "key1";
const myFirstValue = "value1";

const dynamicKeyObject = {
  [myFirstKey]: myFirstValue
};

console.log(dynamicKeyObject); // => { key1: "value1" }
```

> **Exercise D**
> Open the `pokedex` React application again and open the `src/CaughtPokemon.js` file. In this exercise, instead of recording the number of caught Pokemons, we are going to record the names of each Pokemon you caught.
> 1. Make sure the `CaughtPokemon` component is written as a class component
> 2. Add an `<input>` in the `render` method before the `button` (hint: `<input type="text" />`)
> 3. Add a `value` property to the `<input>` set to the state `pokemonNameInput`
> 4. Initialize the state `pokemonNameInput` in the constructor to an empty string `''` (you can try to set something else than an empty string and verify that this value is correctly displayed in your input)
> 5. Create a new `handleInputChange` method
> 6. Add a `onChange` handler to the `<input>` that will call `this.handleInputChange`
> 7. Add a parameter called `event` to the `handleInputChange` method and add a `console.log` with `event.target.value`. In your browser, try writting something in the `<input>`. What do you see in the JavaScript console?
> 8. Use `setState` in `handleInputChange` to record `event.target.value` in the state `pokemonNameInput`. In your browser, try writting something in the `<input>`. What do you see this time in the JavaScript console?
> 9. We are now going to save the user input when clicking on the `<button>`. Initialize `caughtPokemon` to an empty array `[]` instead of 0 in the `constructor`. In the `render`, use `.length` to display the number of items in the state array `caughtPokemon` (hint: it should still display `0` on the screen). Finally, delete the content of `catchPokemon` method (it should be empty, we will rewrite it later).
> 10. In `catchPokemon` method, create a variable `newCaughtPokemon` set to the state `caughtPokemon` and add the value of the state `pokemonNameInput` to it (hint: use `push()` to add a new item in an array).
> 11. In `catchPokemon` method, use `setState` to record the variable `newCaughtPokemon` in the state `caughtPokemon`. Open your browser, enter a pokemon name in the `<input>` and click on the button. Can you see the number of caught pokemon incrementing as you click on the button?
> 12. We are now going to display the names of the caught pokemon. In the `render` method, add a `<ul>` element and use the `.map()` method on the `caughtPokemon` state to loop over each pokemon and return a `<li>` element for each.
> 13. Empty the `<input>` after clicking on the button. For this, in `catchPokemon` method, set the state of `pokemonNameInput` to an empty string `''`.
> 14: **(STRETCH GOAL)** Make sure the user cannot add a pokemon to the `caughtPokemon` state if the value of `pokemonNameInput` state is empty.
We are also using [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals) syntax, which copies properties from one object to another. We are using this to update the state object but without *mutating* the original object.

Let's break this down into 2 steps. Here we create a **new** object based on another object, and **adding** a new property ([interactive example]()):

```js
const sherlock = {
  name: 'Sherlock Holmes',
};

const sherlockAfterMoving = {
  ...sherlock,
  address: '221b Baker Street'
};

console.log(sherlock);
console.log(sherlockAfterMoving);
```

We can also *override* a property if the keys are the same:

```js
const watson = {
  name: 'John Watson',
  address: '123 Fake Road'
};

const watsonAfterMoving = {
  ...watson,
  address: '221b Baker Street'
};

console.log(watson);
console.log(watsonAfterMoving);
```

Notice how Watson "moves" from "123 Fake Road" to "221b Baker Street"? Because the `address` key is in both objects, the **second** one "wins" and overrides the other key.

We are combining all of the concepts above to make a new object, that has all the same properties as the `userData` object, except for the property that is computed from `event.target.name` for the key and `event.target.value` for the value.

## Further Reading

There is a new update to React, which adds a new feature called *Hooks*. It allows you to access the special super powers of state and lifecycle in regular function components. There is an extensive guide in the [official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

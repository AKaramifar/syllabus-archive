## Learning Objectives - React Week 3

### Data fetching (advanced)

TODO (needs further scoping out)

Some initial ideas:

- Cleaning up effects with unsubscribe function
- Update `useEffect()` in response to prop changes using 2nd dependencies argument

### Forms

- Create a simple form in React
  - Use the controlled component pattern
- Use data from a submitted form to update the application

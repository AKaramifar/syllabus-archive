## HTML Recap

The students will have encountered HTML and CSS as part of the application process to join the course. Therefore this lesson will be mostly focused on recapping what the students already know.

## Dev Tool Inspector

Find some interesting web pages to inspect and demo to the class. Point out that the inspector works on every web page.

## HTML Syntax

Highlight the opening and closing syntax, and mention self-closing tags too.

## Semantic HTML

### Thinking in sections

Get the class to work in groups for the exercise. Ideally each group should have a different website to work on.

Then get each group to present what they think the sections are to the rest of the class and discuss. Focus on what a section represents semantically, not what it does in this instance - for example, "this is side section which complements the main content" (i.e. is an `<aside>`), not "this is another story about x".

## CSS Selectors

Demo to the class the following CSS selectors:

- HTML elements
- Classes
- Ids

## Pseudo classes

Demo to the class the following CSS pseudo classes:

- `:hover`
- `:focus`
- `:first-of-type`

## What can we style?

Demo these in the [Semantics CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/z69nnxv5q3)

- Positioning (note: flexbox is covered later)
- Colours
- Borders
- Thickness
- Fonts
- Sizes

## Flexbox

Demo different flexbox settings/values in the [Rainbox CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/znjvoqj1l).

If anyone brings up *Floats*, explain this replaces that concept.

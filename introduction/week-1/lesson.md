# Week 0.1

## Introduction to CodeYourFuture

Welcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of web development!
Over the next nine months you will learn the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Modern front-end development with [React](https://reactjs.org)
- Backend development using [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

We will finish with a four-week long graduation project where you will combine everything you have learned to create a real world web application.

We will follow the [house rules](/others/house-rules.md) for the classes.

### Graduation presentation

Now you will hear from CYF graduates about their journey into software development.

## Ice breaker activity

We will now stand up in a circle so that mentors and students are evenly spread.
Spend the next 10 minutes speaking to our neighbour so that if you are a student you are speaking to a mentor.
Get to know each other!
Then afterwards we will introduce ourselves to the circle as though we are our neighbour!

## Introduction to your machine

We will spend the afternoon getting you acquainted with your machine which you will spend the next nine months with.
It is important that you get on well with your machine!

### Introduction to Ubuntu

### Introduction to Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a team communication tool that we will use to communicate with each other throughout the whole course.
Let's go through some exercises to get acquainted with Slack.

#### Channels

Topics are organised in different channels.

Exercises:
- Find the \#scotland-fun-stuff channel. This is where we organise fun things!
- Find the \#random channel. This is where we post random stuff!

#### Emojis

Emojis make it easy to engage with other people's comments without needing to write a reply.

Exercises:
1. A mentor will now post a random message on Slack. Give it a thumbs up to show that you have read the message!
2. A mentor will now post the name of food that they like. Give it a thumbs up if you like it or a thumbs down if you don't like it!

#### Threads

If everyone replies in the channel then it can get very messy when there are multiple conversations happening at the same time.
To make conversations more organised, we write replies in threads.
This way, a single conversation stays in one thread.

Exercises:
1. A mentor will now post a message asking what your favourite food is. Reply in a thread with your favourite food!
2. A mentor will now post a message asking what your favourite hobby is. Reply in a thread with your favourite hobby!

For bonus points, react with an emoji to your classmate's answers!

### Introduction to VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the application we will use to write code.

#### File tree view

VS Code has an **Explorer** sidebar on the left side which displays files in a tree view.
Creating, renaming and moving files can be done directly in VS Code.

#### Finding files

When working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly, without having to go through the tree view manually.
The keyboard shortcut to do this is: `Ctrl + P` (or `Cmd + P` on Mac)

#### Auto-complete

VS Code has auto-completion, which gives you suggestions of what you can can write next when you type something.
For example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can assign it to:

#### Spell-checking

It can be easy to make spelling mistakes when coding, however VS Code does not have in-built spell-checking.
Let's install a [spell checker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) which will help reduce the number of errors made coding.

### Introduction to the terminal

During your course journey and onwards, the **terminal** (also known as **command line**) will be one of your most valuable tools.
It will help you to interact with you computer faster, by helping you to:

- Create and delete files
- Install web development tools
- Use source control (explained in the next lesson)
- Start a server

All this will make sense as we progress with the lessons.
For now, we would like you to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:

- [Learn the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

#### Commonly used commands

There's a set of commands you should become comfortable with during the course to allow you to effectively move around the filesystem and write software on your laptop.

* `cd` - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: `cd ..`
* `ls` - list the contents of a directory.
  Can also be used as `ls [directory_name]` to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with `cd`) to it
* `pwd` - print the full location of your current directory
* `mkdir [name]` - create a new directory, with the given `name` after a space
* `touch [file_name]` - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like `.css` or `.html`)
* `rm [file_name]` - remove a file
* `rm -r [directory_name]` - remove a directory (**and all files inside that directory**)

## Short break

We will now play a short game!

## Google Classroom

TBD

Notes: used for tracking only, code will not submitted in Google Classroom, only links to PR

## Code.org exercises

We will register on [Code.org](https://code.org/) and complete a few exercises together.

## Homework for next week

1. Complete the following exercises on [Code.org](https://code.org/):
   - Exercises TBC
2. When you have finished all the exercise, submit a link to your Code.org profile in Google Classroom.

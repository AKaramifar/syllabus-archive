# Workshop 1: Basic Automatic Project Deployment using Netlify

# Workshop goals:

- After this first 20minute workshop, students should be able to...
  - configure automated deploy of any STATIC, non-generated site they create on github in future (including all significant HW projects)
  - recover from common mistakes

# Non-goals:

- After the first workshop, the students DON'T need to be able to explain HOW it is working (only what the trigger(s) and results are).

# Workshop pre-reqs:

You have made some very simple sites (even a single index.html)
You have some of those sites as repos on github

You don't need to know anything about command line or npm

# Topics:

- What we'll learn
- Learning more ("we'll revisit later in the course")
- Advantages (two sentences no more) (no codepen banner, few restrictions, free, professional, possibility of using your own domain name)
- Use a standard format for site names for HW projects, and be consistent with your name (or your anonymous handle) in all your CYF projects
  - cyf-[your name]-[exact project name as supplied by teacher]
  - neill-cakes-cyf.netlify.com
  - lucy-cakes-cyf.netlify.com
  - ali-cakes-cyf.netlify.com
  - jon-cakes-cyf.netlify.com
- Putting your full url into your github repo website field and in your homework submission
- Let's practice - 3 sites + 1 to delete! (cakes, landing page from application, a fun p5.js template for their previous khan academy work)
  your cv & portfolio template (week 2))
  - test it on your phone, and bookmark it
  - test someone else's!
- Deleting your hosted site (you decide you don't want it public) - practice deleting a site
- Trouble-shooting - when things go wrong
  - (delete & recreate site is possible (e.g. if you use the wrong github account or repo), renaming site is possible)
  - when repos don't show up in the menu
  - site is not deploying on push to master (logs, branch awareness, propagation delay)
- Yes, alternatives exist, but you'll do it this way for CYF projects - make easier for volunteers. (You are free to deploy elsewhere, too!)
- recap: What we learned
- Reference material:
  - The CYF Netlify auto-deploy CheatSheet (for when you forget all this stuff)
  - official docs

# More docs

- This video tutorial (2 minutes) is old and has some inaccuracies - you can watch it but for detail, use OUR instructions https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#deploy-summary
- These written instructions are also not perfect (you should not fill in "dir" and "build command" (until the React module) https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/
